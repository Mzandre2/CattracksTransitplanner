# Project Description
Currently, no route planning system is available for the UC Merced CatTracks network. While bus schedulers exist for the Merced County Transit (The Bus) and YARTS (Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System), CatTracks—being exclusive to UC Merced students—is not integrated into public apps like Transit or Google Maps.
Our project aims to address this gap by creating a bus journey planner specifically for CatTracks. Students will be able to input their starting point, destination, and preferred time of travel. The system will then calculate the optimal routes based on this information.
